EXTRACT_PROMPT='You are reviewing a Claude Code session transcript. Extract 0-3 distinct, reusable learnings worth storing as persistent memories.

For each learning output a JSON object on a single line:
{"title": "...", "content": "## Executive Summary\n\n...", "tags": [...], "category": "...", "importanceScore": 0.0-1.0}

Only output JSON lines. No prose. If nothing is worth storing, output nothing.

Rules:
- Only store things with long-term reuse value
- Include WHY, not just WHAT
- Do not store ephemeral task details'

# Extract via `claude -p` (valid), then write each JSON line straight to the vault.
# store-learning.mjs validates JSON, slugifies, and skips existing memories.
# Persist node's stderr to ~/.total-recall/.extract.log instead of /dev/null:
# store-learning.mjs emits a "X written, Y skipped, Z errors" summary to stderr
# "for debugging", and any crash/import failure (e.g. a build-drifted missing
# dist/frontmatter.mjs → ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND) lands there too. /dev/null
# discarded both, so a persistent extraction failure dropped every PreCompact
# learning with ZERO observable signal — no log, no error, no exit-code change
# (the trailing `|| true` still swallows the exit). Mirror sync-org-memory.sh,
# which persists its backgrounded children's stderr to ~/.total-recall/org/.sync.log
# for the same discoverability. stdout stays clean (the hook only emits the
# final {"continue":true}); only stderr is tee'd to the log.
EXTRACT_LOG="$HOME/.total-recall/.extract.log"
# Cap the transcript fed to `claude -p`. A long session's transcript.jsonl grows
# past claude -p's stdin limit ("piped stdin input exceeds 10MB") — observed
# failing every extraction on large sessions, with the error line then counted as
# a bogus store-learning error. Feed only the most recent ~1MB (tail -c): the
# recent turns are what a PreCompact extraction should summarize anyway, and 1MB
# is comfortably under the limit while still spanning many turns. tail -c may slice
# mid-line, but the transcript is JSONL and claude -p reads it as free-form context
# (not strict JSON), so a truncated first line is harmless.
