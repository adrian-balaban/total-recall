# session-end.sh — SessionEnd hook for total-recall
#
# Runs when Claude Code ends a session. Three responsibilities:
#
#   1. Log a session-end marker to ~/.total-recall/.session-end.log so the user
#      can answer "did the session even reach the SessionEnd hook?" without
#      reasoning about MCP stdio timing. The MCP server's stdin-end handler
#      (src/index.ts) is the primary flush trigger; this log is observability
#      for that path, not the flush itself.
#
#   2. Belt-and-braces SIGTERM to the running MCP child process. The stdio-end
#      handler is the main path; SIGTERM here is the backup if the stdio
#      streams are held open for any reason (e.g. a stuck transport). The MCP
#      child has SIGTERM/SIGINT wired to shutdown() (src/index.ts:30-31), so
#      flushPending → flushEmbeddings → process.exit(0) run either way.
#
#   3. Emit a SessionEnd JSON envelope on stdout so Claude Code records the
#      hook ran. Like SessionStart, the additionalContext must carry
#      hookEventName:"SessionEnd" — Claude Code DROPS envelopes missing it
#      (silent drop, no UI surface). See hook-scripts.test.ts #24.
#
# Idempotent. No required tools beyond bash; uses ps + grep + kill which are
# available on every Unix. Every action is best-effort: a miss (no MCP child
# running, permission denied on .total-recall/) is silent — the SessionEnd
# hook is observability, not correctness, and a non-zero exit here would
# surface as a "hook failed" warning in Claude Code on every session end,
# which is more noise than value.
