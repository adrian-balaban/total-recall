# fires once per hook registration and would inject the memory index TWICE —
# a doubled "Active Memory Index" block in the session context. When the hook
# runtime forwards the accumulated additionalContext from prior hooks on
# stdin, an already-injected index carries our "## Total Recall v" marker.
# Detect it and emit a bare {"continue":true} (no additionalContext) so only
# the first injection wins. Stdin is otherwise unused by this hook, so
# consuming it here is safe; if stdin carries no marker we fall through to
# normal injection (no regression for runtimes that don't forward context).

INSTRUCTIONS="## Total Recall v$VERSION — Active Memory Index

Total Recall v$VERSION active. The following memories are already in context. Use keys with get_memories_by_keys before searching.

### Retrieval Decision Tree
1. Scan this injected index first (free — already in context)
2. If key found → get_memories_by_keys(summary=true) for overview
3. If full depth needed → get_memories_by_keys(summary=false)
4. Only use search_index / recall_memory when key NOT in this index

### Capture Rules
- Call store_memory DIRECTLY from main agent (never delegate to subagent)
- Check for duplicates before storing
- Always include executive summary with WHY, not just WHAT
- Preferred categories: architecture, decisions, troubleshooting, meetings, knowledge, journal

### Memory Index

# hookSpecificOutput REQUIRES hookEventName:"SessionStart" or additionalContext is
# silently dropped (verified against the Claude Code hooks reference). Without it,
# the injected memory index — the plugin's core feature — never reached Claude.
# JSON-encode via node (node is this plugin's hard dependency; python3 is not).
