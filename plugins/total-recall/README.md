# 🧠 Total Recall

Persistent knowledge and memory management for Claude Code and Gemini CLI.

Stores memories locally as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, indexes them for fast hybrid search (TF-IDF × Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, optionally fused with vector embeddings), and uses per-client lifecycle hooks to inject relevant context automatically at session start.

> **Installation:** see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) — profiles (minimal / complete, complete is the default), per-client setup, Windows notes, org vault.
> **Internals:** see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 😵 The Problem

At the end of every conversation, an AI coding assistant loses all accumulated context. Decisions, preferences, discussed architectures — gone. You re-explain the same project details session after session; feedback you gave the model never persists; architecture decisions accumulate nowhere.

**Total Recall** gives the model a persistent, searchable memory between sessions:

- **What it is:** an MCP server with 17 tools + automatic lifecycle hooks + a vault of plain Markdown files under `~/.total-recall/`.
- **What it is not:** it does not send data to the cloud (the personal vault is fully local), does not use an opaque database (every memory is a readable `.md` file you can git-version and open in Obsidian), and does not replace context — it injects into it.

---

## 💾 Architecture & Storage

Two separate vaults live under `~/.total-recall/`:

| Vault | Path | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Personal** | `~/.total-recall/personal-vault/` | Default for all memories (stays local). |
| **Org** | `~/.total-recall/org/org-vault/` | Used when tagged `org`. Syncs to a remote Git repo with a privacy filter. |

### On-disk layout

```
~/.total-recall/
├── index.json               ← flat index: key → MemoryMetadata
├── invertedIndex.json       ← TF-IDF inverted index: token → {docs, idf}
├── .index-cache.txt         ← summary injected at SessionStart (shell-readable)
├── config.json              ← optional configuration (see below)
├── personal-vault/
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── db-choice.md     ← one memory: YAML frontmatter + Markdown body
│   ├── decisions/ …
│   └── vectors.db           ← sqlite-vec embeddings (optional)
└── org/
    └── org-vault/           ← team memories, git-synced (branch org-vault)
```

Each memory is a `.md` file:

## Executive Summary

Prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL for new projects because of JSONB support…
```

### Design philosophy: own algorithms, one hard dependency

The only mandatory dependency is `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. TF-IDF, Ebbinghaus decay, RRF, and the YAML-frontmatter parser are all written from scratch. Why:

1. **Security** — no `gray-matter` → no `js-yaml` CVE class (GHSA-h67p-54hq-rp68); the minimal parser is pinned by property-based tests (fast-check).
2. **Coherent scoring** — title-boost, tag-boost, and decay are one formula, not three libraries.
3. **Determinism** — zero LLM calls in the search path, zero cost, works offline/air-gapped.
4. **Auditability** — every scoring decision is observable via `get_stats`.

Only ONNX (`@huggingface/transformers`) and `sqlite-vec` remain external — and both are optional.

### Privacy Filter & Org Sync

*   **Fail-closed by default**: blocks high-entropy secret tokens/keys, labeled secrets (e.g. a pasted `aws_secret_access_key = …`), all email addresses, and validated credit cards (Luhn), IBANs (ISO 13616 mod-97), and formatted phone numbers before any git push. If the filter cannot analyze the content, it does **not** push.
*   **Email whitelist**: allow specific domains via `allowedEmailDomains: ["yourcompany.com"]` in `config.json`.
*   **Author protection**: org memories can only be overwritten/updated by their author (OS username).
*   *Note: pronouns are deliberately allowed (their false-positive rate blocked legitimate work notes); the `personal` and `org` tags are mutually exclusive to prevent accidental sync.*

## 🛠️ 17 MCP Tools

All tool calls operate against an in-memory index (`index.json`), making read/search operations extremely fast and free of disk I/O. Speak naturally — *"remember that…"* / *"remind me…"* — and the model picks the right tool.

| Tool | Function | Notable Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `store_memory` | Create a memory | Routes to Org vault if tagged `org`. Overwrite needs `force=true` (refused on `no-prune` files). |
| `update_memory` | Edit a memory | Preserves created timestamp and appends to session history (capped at 50). Re-embeds on content/tags/importance change. |
| `delete_memory` | Delete a memory | Refuses `no-prune` memories unless `force=true` is passed. |
| `rebuild_index` | Rescan filesystem | Full re-scan of vaults, rebuilding TF-IDF while preserving access stats. |
| `recall_memory` | Hybrid search | TF-IDF, Ebbinghaus decay, and optional vector embeddings (fused via RRF). |
| `search_index` | Metadata search | Fast query scan of the in-memory index; does not read files, no accessCount bump. |
| `list_memories` | Browse vault | Paginated listing of memory metadata (filter by tag/category/date). |
| `get_memories_by_keys` | Fetch memory | Batch fetch by key; full content or summary; served through an LRU cache. |
| `get_stats` | Audit plugin | Totals, cache stats, recent error log (last 10), latency percentiles, and a `vector` block (`enabled`/`depsPresent` + live vs stored model/dim). `enabled` defaults to true when the optional deps are loadable, so vector search reads as on from a fresh session. |
| `get_timeline` | Chronological view | Memories grouped and sorted by modification dates. |
| `get_related_memories` | Find relations | Jaccard similarity of tags with a category boost. |
| `prune_memories` | Clean stale entries | Lists Ebbinghaus decay candidates (does not auto-delete). Excludes `no-prune`. |
| `rerank_memories` | Semantic rerank | Reorders candidate keys by cosine similarity to a query using embeddings. `keys` capped at 200 (extras dropped, order preserved). |
| `export_memories` | Bulk export | Portable JSON archive; filter by keys, category, or tag. Unreadable bodies become `{key, error}` entries (counted in `errors`), never silent empty content. Closes the "new laptop" scenario. |
| `import_memories` | Bulk import | Restores from an `export_memories` archive; skips existing keys unless `force=true`; skips entries carrying an `error` field so a failed export read can't clobber a live memory. |
| `delete_memories` | Bulk delete | Deletes a list of keys; `confirm=true` required (no default). A reserved `no-prune` key (without `force`) is recorded as a per-key error and the batch continues — not a batch reject. Closes the `prune_memories` loop. |
| `confirm_memory` | Feedback signal | `useful=true` increments confirmations; `useful=false` increments flags — both feed retention scoring. |

## 🔍 Search Pipeline

```
recall_memory(query)
  │
  ├─ tfidfSearch(query)
  │    ├─ tokenize(query) → tokens (EN↔RO expansion if enableMultilingualSearch)
  │    ├─ per token: lookup in invertedIndex
  │    ├─ score = TF × IDF × title-boost(2×) × tag-boost(1.5×)
  │    └─ × computeRetentionStrength(importance, daysSince, accessCount, confirmations, flags)
  │
  ├─ [optional: vector deps installed]
  │    ├─ embed(query) → sqlite-vec KNN
  │    └─ Reciprocal Rank Fusion(tfidf, vector), k=60:  score(d) = Σ 1/(60 + rank_i(d))
  │
  └─ slice to `limit`, bump accessCount, return with/without full content
```

> **What is TF-IDF?** Term Frequency × Inverse Document Frequency — the classic text-search score: a word counts a lot if it appears **often in this document** (TF) but **rarely across the collection** (IDF). The *inverted index* is the reverse map `word → documents containing it`, like a book index — search reads the index, never the files.

### The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve (1885), in code

Memories fade like human memory: unimportant, unaccessed memories decay out of results; every access "refreshes" them.

```
λ        = 0.16 × (1 − importanceScore × 0.8)
strength = clamp(importance × exp(−λ × daysSince)
                 × (1 + accessCount × 0.2 + confirmations × 0.1 − flags × 0.1), 0, 1)
```

| importanceScore | λ (forgetting speed) | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 (critical) | 0.032 | Slow decay — relevant for weeks |
| 0.5 (normal) | 0.096 | Medium decay |
| 0.3 (low) | 0.122 | Fast decay — fades from results in days |

Each access adds +20% retention; each `confirm_memory(useful=true)` +10%; each flag −10% — so a frequently accessed memory that was flagged wrong today drops, refining retention beyond raw access counts (an idea validated by [mozilla-ai/cq](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cq)'s endorsement signal).

*   **Immortality (`no-prune` tag)**: excludes the memory from `prune_memories` and protects it from accidental deletion or routine overwrite. Useful for architecture decisions (ADRs).

### Embeddings & vector search (optional)

Optional, lazy-loaded, fully local — the plugin degrades cleanly to TF-IDF without the native deps (offline machines, failed native builds). No cloud APIs, no API keys; vectors are computed once at write time (`vectors.db`), never re-embedded on read; heavy deps are esbuild-`external` so the base bundle stays tiny; `flushPending()` on SIGTERM/SIGINT guarantees vectors hit disk on exit.

`get_stats` reports vector search as **enabled by default** when the optional deps are loadable — it probes `@huggingface/transformers` + `sqlite-vec` + the `better-sqlite3` native binding directly (not the lazy-loaded pipeline, which hasn't fired on a fresh session), so a brand-new session reads `vector.enabled: true` instead of looking disabled-while-idle. The one real "disabled" state is a missing `better-sqlite3` binding — the post-`claude plugin update` footgun, where the new version dir ships the dep source-only because `install.sh` doesn't re-run. If `get_stats` shows `depsPresent: false`, run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` in the plugin cache dir (the in-process self-heal in `vectorStore.ts` tries this once automatically).

```bash
npm install --no-save @huggingface/transformers sqlite-vec better-sqlite3   # or install.sh --complete
```

Why hybrid: TF-IDF is exact-token ("k8s pod OOM" misses "workload killed for memory pressure"); the embedding model handles paraphrase. The default `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, via the in-process HuggingFace pipeline) covers English paraphrase; cross-language retrieval (store in Romanian, retrieve in English) is handled by the `enableMultilingualSearch` query-token expansion, not the embedder. RRF fuses the two rankings by position only (scale-free), since lexical scores and cosine similarities aren't directly comparable.

### Multilingual search (EN↔RO)

`enableMultilingualSearch: true` expands query tokens between English and Romanian:

```
# 1. Store (in English):
> "remember that we chose PostgreSQL over MySQL because of JSONB support"

# 2. In a new session, ask in ROMANIAN:
> "care a fost decizia noastră despre baza de date?"
→ recall_memory(query="decizie baza de date")
→ expansion maps „decizie"→"decision", „baza de date"→"database" → finds the English memory ✅
```

## 🪝 Lifecycle Hooks

> Before context compaction (`PreCompact`), the plugin **automatically saves the session's learnings** — knowledge survives even when the context is wiped.

### `SessionStart` (4 sequential steps)

```
1. pull-org-vault.sh       — git pull on the org-sync branch (config.orgBranch, default org-vault; if configured)
2. build-memory-index.sh   — frontmatter scan → .index-cache.txt
3. load-memory-index.sh    — inject the memory index into context (Claude Code only)
4. check-sync-errors.sh    — warn if org-sync pushes failed since last success
```

Effect: every new Claude session automatically receives a summary of all your memories — without asking.

### `PostToolUse` (matcher: `mcp__plugin_total-recall_total-recall__(store_memory|update_memory|delete_memory)`)

`sync-org-memory.sh` — checks the `org` tag, applies the privacy filter, commits/pushes to the team's org-sync branch (`config.orgBranch`, default `org-vault`), and rebuilds `.index-cache.txt`. Bursts of org writes are **coalesced**: an atomic job queue + `flock`ed background worker means one git sync process per session, not one per key. Pulled teammate memories are reconciled into the live index **without a restart** (marker-file poller).

> **Why the matcher is a regex, not a bare tool list.** Claude Code treats a matcher containing only letters/digits/`_`/`-`/spaces/`,`/`|` as an **exact string list** compared verbatim against the full tool name. Plugin MCP tools are named `mcp__plugin_total-recall_total-recall__<tool>`, so a bare `store_memory|update_memory|delete_memory` never matched and the org-sync hook silently never fired. The parens force the **regex** path so it matches the `__<tool>` suffix.

### `PreCompact`

`extract-and-store-memories.sh` — reads the session transcript, asks the model to extract 0–3 key learnings as JSON lines, and `store-learning.mjs` writes them directly as `.md` files to the personal vault (no MCP round-trip; never overwrites existing files).

### `SessionEnd`

Logs the session and flushes pending embedding writes before exit.

---

## 📇 Retrieval order (cheapest first)

1. Injected index at SessionStart (free — already in context)
2. `get_memories_by_keys(summary=true)` — if you know the key
3. `search_index(query=…)` — fast metadata, no file reads
4. `recall_memory(query=…, full=false)` — TF-IDF + Ebbinghaus
5. `recall_memory(query=…, full=true)` — with full content

The bundled `/total-recall:memory-workflow` skill teaches the model this order plus capture rules (executive summary, dedup check, importanceScore).

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (`config.json`)

Configure total-recall by editing `~/.total-recall/config.json`:

```json
{
  "personalVault": "~/my-custom-personal-vault",
  "orgVault": "~/my-custom-org-vault",
  "orgRepo": "https://github.com/you/your-vault.git",
  "allowedEmailDomains": ["yourcompany.com"],
  "embeddingModel": "Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
  "enableMultilingualSearch": true
}
```

*   **embeddingModel**: optional override for the local HuggingFace transformer model (defaults to `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384-dim). Point this at a different `@huggingface/transformers`-compatible model if you need a different embedding space — note that changing the model dimension drops the existing vector index (it is rebuilt on the next write).
*   **enableMultilingualSearch**: Romanian/English query token expansion for cross-language lexical retrieval.

## 🚀 Installation

See **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** for the full guide (profiles, Windows, org vault, Codex). TL;DR:

```bash
cd plugins/total-recall && npm install && npm run build

claude plugin install "$(pwd)"       # Claude Code
./install.sh --gemini                # Gemini CLI
./install.sh --standalone            # Standalone (~/.claude/settings.json)
```

`install.sh` asks up front: **a. default** (no optional deps, no local LLM) or **b. complete** (vector search + local embeddings).

## 💻 Client Compatibility

| Client | MCP Tools | Hook Side Effects (Sync/Index) | Context Injection (`additionalContext`) | Playbook Skills |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (SessionStart/PostToolUse) | ✅ Yes |
| **Gemini CLI** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (silently dropped by Gemini) | ❌ No |
| **Codex CLI** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

### Client-Specific Integration Details

*   **Claude Code**: zero-touch. Hooks automatically pull git changes, rebuild the local cache, and inject memories at session start.
*   **Gemini CLI**: registers through `gemini-extension.json`. Tool namespace is `mcp_total-recall_<tool>` (single underscore); Gemini renames the hook events (PostToolUse→AfterTool, PreCompact→PreCompress) — handled by `hooks/hooks.gemini.json`.
*   **Codex CLI**: MCP server only (no hooks) — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#codex-cli-mcp-only-no-hooks).
*   **Ollama backends**: total-recall works as persistent memory for `ollama launch claude` too — same vault regardless of whether Claude Code talks to Anthropic or a local model.
*   **Windows**: supported via Git Bash — keys and git paths are `/`-normalized internally; see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#windows).

---

## 📝 [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Integration

Both vaults open directly as Obsidian vaults (plain `.md` + YAML frontmatter).

*   **Simple YAML**: stick to flat string arrays and simple scalars. `src/frontmatter.ts` does not support anchors or multi-line block scalars.
*   **No file watching**: Obsidian edits are not loaded until a new session starts or you call `rebuild_index`.
*   **Wiki-links**: `[[wikilinks]]` are tokenized by their raw words; the link graph is not resolved.
*   **Sync safeguard**: do not use Obsidian Sync on the org-vault directory; rely exclusively on total-recall's git sync so the privacy filter runs before every push.

Projects and ideas this plugin drew on:

*   **[strvmarv/total-recall](https://github.com/strvmarv/total-recall)** and **[davegoldblatt/total-recall](https://github.com/davegoldblatt/total-recall)** — same name, different trade-offs (see table below); studying them shaped the "bounded local memory, plain files" positioning.
*   **Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885)** — the forgetting curve `e^(−t/S)` behind retention scoring.
*   **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (Cormack, Clarke & Buettcher, 2009) — the scale-free rank fusion (k=60) used for the hybrid lexical+vector merge.
*   **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** — the "your knowledge is a folder of Markdown files with frontmatter" storage model.
*   **[mozilla-ai/cq](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/cq)** — the open standard for *shared agent learning*. Complementary, not competing: cq = operational lessons shared between agents via a reviewed store; total-recall = *your* context memory (decisions, preferences, architecture) as `.md` files + git, no server, no review pipeline. cq's endorsement mechanism directly inspired total-recall's `confirm_memory` confirmations/flags signal in the retention score.
