// Regression test for the session-end memory-loss bug.
//
// What this pins
// ──────────────
// On session end, Claude Code closes the MCP child's stdio streams — it does
// NOT send SIGTERM. Before the fix, only SIGTERM/SIGINT/beforeExit triggered
// `flushPending()`. `beforeExit` doesn't fire while stdin is held open (the
// readable stream keeps the event loop alive); SIGTERM/SIGINT are not what
// Claude Code delivers on session end. So the 1-second `scheduleSave` debounce
// was killed mid-flight, the in-memory `memIndex` mutations from the last
// `store_memory` never reached `index.json`, and the user saw "memories not
// saved at session end" on the next boot's reconcile.
//
// The fix added `process.stdin.on('end', shutdown)` and
// `process.stdin.on('close', shutdown)` in src/index.ts. This test asserts
// both listeners are registered in the BUILT production entry
// (dist/index.js) and in the source — so a future refactor that drops them
// (e.g. "simplify the exit handlers") is caught at npm test, not after
// another silent-drop session.
//
// Why a static source-level test (not a spawned subprocess)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A subprocess test would need to spin up the real MCP server, drive a
// JSON-RPC initialize + tools/call, close stdin, and assert the index was
// flushed. That works (verified in ad-hoc dev) but takes ~3s per test and
// needs a working MCP SDK init in a non-TTY context. The CONTRACT we care
// about is: "stdin end → flushPending → saveNow → index.json on disk."
// That contract decomposes into two sub-claims: (1) the listener is wired,
// (2) the listener body does the right thing. (1) is fast and deterministic
// to assert statically. (2) is covered by the existing flushPending unit
// tests in persistence.test.ts / persistence-readonly-flush.test.ts (the
// SIGTERM/SIGINT path that shutdown() reuses). The two together pin the fix.
